📚 University Library Database Project
📖 Introduction

This project was done for the Database Management Systems for Security (IE2042) module at SLIIT.
It is about creating a Library Management Database that can handle books, journals, media, users, borrowing/returning, fines, and notifications.

We also studied common database vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and unpatched systems, and explained how to prevent them.
